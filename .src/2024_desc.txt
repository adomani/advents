-- Day 1
The input is a pair of lists of natural numbers out of which a location should be produced.

### Description

#### Part 1

Sort each of the two lists and compute the distances of the corresponding entries in the
sorted lists

#### Part 2

For each entry `l` of the first list, find how many entries of the second list are equal to
`l` and multiply `l` by this number.
Then, add everything up.
-- Day 2
The input is a list of lists of levels -- each level is a natural number.

### Description

#### Part 1

Find all the rows of the input whose entries are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing and that never
do they increase or decrease by more than 3.


#### Part 2

Same as part 1, except that you are allowed to drop one level from each entry before checking the condition.
-- Day 3
Parsing a string with errors.

### Description

#### Part 1

Scan the input string for substrings of the form `mul(d1,d2)`, where `d1` and `d2` are only allowed to be `1`, `2` or `3` digit numbers.
Accumulate the products of such numbers, ignoring every malformed substring.


#### Part 2

Same as part 1, except that now we should be aware of the fact that interspered in the string there are also some `do()` and `don't()` substring.
We should only count a multiplication if the closest `do()`/`don't()` substring is a `do()`, ignoring the other multiplications.
If you parse the input by lines, remember to persist the `do()`/`don't()` information across lines!
-- Day 4
Look for the word `XMAS` and `X-MAS` in a grid of letters.

### Description

#### Part 1

For part 1, we scan for the word `XMAS` starting anywhere on the grid and continuing in each of the 8 directions:
horizontal, vertical or diagonal and left/right or up/down.

#### Part 2

For part 2, we should find instead an `X` of `MAS`.
This means that we are looking for a rotation of the pattern
```
M M
 A
S S
```
anywhere on the grid.
-- Day 5
Checking whether some pages are correctly sorted.

### Description

The input begins with a list of pairs of natural numbers, in the form `n1|n2`, representing the correct ordering that the pages should have.
It then continues with a list of actual orders of pages, in the form `p₁,p₂,...,pₙ`.

#### Part 1

Add the number of pages that appear in the middle of each *correctly ordered* list of pages.

#### Part 2

Add the number of pages that appear in the middle of each *incorrectly ordered* list of pages.
-- Day 6
The input is a map with locations of obstacles and the location of a guard.

### Description

#### Part 1

The guard moves in a fixed direction, until it reaches an obstacle.
At that point, it rotates by 90⁰ clockwise and continues.
The first question is to determine how many locations on the map the guard occupies, before exiting the map.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should find all positions on the grid such that placing one further an obstacle in that position, makes the guard enter into a loop.
-- Day 7
Lists of total and possible operands, but missing operations!

### Description

#### Part 1

Each row starts with a "target" value and a list of possible summands.
Inserting `*` and `+` in all possible ways (and *always* associate to the left),
sum the values of the rows that *can* represent a correct operation, with an appropriate
choice of `*` and `+`.

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, except that there is a third operation that is allowed:
concatenation of natural numbers, written in decimal.
This extra operation maps `12` and `345` to `12345`.
-- Day 8
Find the resonant harmonics in a grid of antenna locations.

### Description

#### Part 1

The input consists of a map with the positions of antennas.
For each pair `(p, q)` of locations of distinct antennas of the same kind,
we determine the location `p + (p - q)` of a resonant antinode.
We count how many such resonant antinodes there are that are contained in the initial grid.

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, except that instead of just the location `p + (p - q)`, we want to count all
locations `p + n * (p - q)`, for all `n ≠ 0`, again only counting the positions that end up in the
initial grid.
-- Day 9
Fragment and defragment a disk, based on blocks that are free or occupied by files.

### Description

#### Part 1

The input is a long number in decimal notation.
The digit encode the location of consecutive free blocks and file blocks of a file-system.
The goal of the first part is to compress as much as possible the files,
by moving individual occupied blocks from the right to the left-most available free space.

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, except that now we move all the blocks of a file together, rather than fragmenting.
If there is no consecutive sequence of free blocks at least as long as the current file to the left of the file,
then we skip the file and move to the next one to its left.
-- Day 10
The input is a height map.

### Description

#### Part 1

A valid path starts at any `0`, ends at any `9` and increases by exactly one at each step.
Steps are only allowed in the four "grid" directions: up, down, left, right.
Determine the number of pairs `(start, end)`, where
* `start` is the position of a `0`;
* `end` is the position of a `9`;
* there is a path paths from `start` to `end`.

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, except that now we should determine the total number of valid paths,
not just their existence.
-- Day 11
The input is a sequence of numbers written on stones.

### Description

#### Part 1

Each time you blink, each stones changes, by either modifying its value or splitting into two stones.
Determine the total sum of the values of the configuration of the stone after you blink 25 times.

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, except that now you blink 75 times.
-- Day 12
The input is a grid with locations of where different kinds of plants have been planted.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should find the sum of `area * perimeter` for each connected component of the garden containing
plants of a single variety.

#### Part 2

Similar to part one, except that we should find the sum of `area * corners` for each connected
component of the garden containing plants of a single variety.
-- Day 13
The input is a description of various games with the claw.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should determine the intersection points between two lines.
All the lines are non-parallel, the intersection points are required to be integers and
non-negative.

Once we found these intersection points, we tally them using `3` and `1` as weights
for their coordinates.

#### Part 2

Similar to part one, except that the target positions are now increased by `10000000000000`.
-- Day 14
The input is a list of positions and velocities of robots in a periodic grid.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should determine the product of the numbers of robots in each of the four quadrants of the grid,
after the robots moved 100 times.

#### Part 2

There is an Easter Egg: once in every period, a subset of the robots draws a Christmas tree in one of the quadrats.
We should determine the first time that this happens.
