-- Day 1
The input is a lists strings, starting with either `L` or `R` and continuing with a natural number.
The first character represents whether we rotate left or right, the following natural number
represents by how much.

### Description

#### Part 1

Count how many times, following the rotations, we reach the position `0` at the end of some
rotation.

#### Part 2

Count how many times, following the rotations, we cross through the position `0`, possibly multiple
times with a single rotation.
-- Day 2
The input is a sequence of ranges of IDs that are all natural numbers.

### Description

#### Part 1

Find the IDs in the given ranges that consist of the concatenation of twice the same natural number,
when written to base `10` and report their sum.

For instance, `123123`, `1010` and `22` are examples of natural numbers that we are seeking.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should find all numbers in the given ranges that are a concatenation of
*at least* two identical numbers and again report the sum of all such IDs.
-- Day 3
The input is a list of sequences of joltages, each of which is a natural number from `1` to `9`.

### Description

#### Part 1

Find the pairs of joltages in each sequence that are the digits of the largest natural number
that can be extracted in order.
Report the sum of such two-digit numbers.

For instance, from `321` extract `32` and from `123` extract `23`.
Their sum would be `55`.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should do the same as in part 1, except that we want to sum the largest
12-digit numbers that can be extracted.
-- Day 4
The input is a grid with the positions of rolls of paper.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should find the number of rolls of papers that have fewer than `4` nearby rolls of paper.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should recursively remove all rolls of paper that have fewer than `4` nearby
rolls of paper, until no more rolls can be removed.
We should report how rolls we removed in the process.
