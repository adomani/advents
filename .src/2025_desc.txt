-- Day 1
The input is a lists strings, starting with either `L` or `R` and continuing with a natural number.
The first character represents whether we rotate left or right, the following natural number
represents by how much.

### Description

#### Part 1

Count how many times, following the rotations, we reach the position `0` at the end of some
rotation.

#### Part 2

Count how many times, following the rotations, we cross through the position `0`, possibly multiple
times with a single rotation.
-- Day 2
The input is a sequence of ranges of IDs that are all natural numbers.

### Description

#### Part 1

Find the IDs in the given ranges that consist of the concatenation of twice the same natural number,
when written to base `10` and report their sum.

For instance, `123123`, `1010` and `22` are examples of natural numbers that we are seeking.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should find all numbers in the given ranges that are a concatenation of
*at least* two identical numbers and again report the sum of all such IDs.
-- Day 3
The input is a list of sequences of joltages, each of which is a natural number from `1` to `9`.

### Description

#### Part 1

Find the pairs of joltages in each sequence that are the digits of the largest natural number
that can be extracted in order.
Report the sum of such two-digit numbers.

For instance, from `321` extract `32` and from `123` extract `23`.
Their sum would be `55`.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should do the same as in part 1, except that we want to sum the largest
12-digit numbers that can be extracted.
-- Day 4
The input is a grid with the positions of rolls of paper.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should find the number of rolls of papers that have fewer than `4` nearby rolls of paper.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we should recursively remove all rolls of paper that have fewer than `4` nearby
rolls of paper, until no more rolls can be removed.
We should report how rolls we removed in the process.
-- Day 5
Finding fresh ingredients for the cafeteria

### Description

#### Part 1

The input consists of ingredient ID ranges and individual IDs.

First, we should determine how many of the individual IDs are contained in at least one of the
ranges.

#### Part 2

Next, we should figure out how many distinct ingredient IDs are contained in the union of all the
IDs in all of the ranges.
-- Day 6
Helping cephalopods with their maths homework

### Description

#### Part 1

Read the input one way to add and multiply various numbers.

#### Part 2

Read the input in a different way to add and multiply various numbers.
-- Day 7
Splitting tachyon manifolds

### Description

#### Part 1

The input is a map with the positions of the splitters and the starting tachyon.
We should determine how many times the tachyon splits, while travelling in a
*classical* tachyon manifold.

#### Part 2

For part 2, we should determine how many times the tachyon splits, while travelling in a
*quantum* tachyon manifold.
-- Day 8
Powering up Christmas decorations

### Description

#### Part 1

The input is a list of positions in 3-space of junction boxes.
The first part, asks to connect the `1000` pairs positions that are closest to one another,
find the sizes of the `3` largest resulting connected components and report the product of these
sizes.

#### Part 2

Now, we should add all edges, from the shortest to the largest, until the graph has a single
connected component.
Once that happens, we should report the product of the `x`-coordinates of the last edge that was
added.
-- Day 9
The input are the coordinates of the red tiles.

### Description

#### Part 1

In part 1, we should determine the largest area of a rectangle with two opposite corners
on the red tiles.

#### Part 2

In part 2, we should still find the largest rectangle with opposite vertices on the red tiles,
but the rectangle must be entirely contained in the interior of the path.
-- Day 9
The inputs are switches to flips, patterns for flipping and joltages.

### Description

#### Part 1

In part 1, we should determine the minimum number of flips in patterns that take us from all switches being off to creating the input pattern.

We need to return the total minimum number of required switches.

#### Part 2

In part 2, we should do something similar, but adding to joltages, instead of flipping switches.
