Finding the first and last digit (or the English name of a digit) in each row of the input.
### Description

#### Part 1

I simply scanned the characters in each line,
stopping at the first digit.

Next, I recycled the function, scanning the reversed list of characters.

#### Part 2

Very similar to part 1:
scan the characters as before, but also try
to match English spelling of digits,
before moving on to the next character.

I also recycled the previous function for the reverse scanning.
