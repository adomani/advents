### 2021

* Day 12, part 2 is a little slow (~10s, finding a path in a cave,
  allowing the repetition of one small cave)
* Day 15, part 2 is slow (find quickest way through a maze -- takes approx 85s)
* Day 20, part 2 is slow (iterate 50 times the image enhancing algorithm -- the test takes ~11s, the solution ~65s)
* Day 25, part 1 is slow (moving seacucumbers -- takes approximately 1m40s)

### 2023

* Day 21, part 2
* Day 22, speed up falling bricks
* Day 23, part 2
* Day 24, fix part 2 example?
* Day 25, use Lean

### 2024

* Day 6, part 2 is somewhat slow (moving guard in a maze, finding locations of obstacles to create loops, approx 24s)
* Day 7, part 2 is slow (filling in binary operations, trying to achieve a fixed total -- approx 1m30)
* Day 9, part 2 is slow (defragmenting a file-system, takes approximately 1 minute)
* Day 12, part 1 and 2 are slow (connected components, perimeters and corners, approx 1m each answer)
* Day 15, part 2 is slow (moving boxes around, approximately 3 minutes to get each answer)
* Day 16, part 1 and 2 are slow (Reindeer maze, 20/25 seconds to get each answer)
* Day 18, part 2 has an off-by-1 error with a different input (historians and corrupted bytes --
  hex-like maze, 3-4s)
* Day 19, part 2 is slow (cheating programs through a maze -- Manhattan distance,
  approximately 1m -- try to implement by keeping track of the fact that shorter cheats are reused
  multiple times)
* Day 22, part 2 is slow (minimizing price windows to obtain bananas -- bitwise operations,
  approximately 3m -- try to streamline the generation of the bits for speed up?)
