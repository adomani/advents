### 2021

* Day 12, part 2 is a little slow (~10s, finding a path in a cave,
  allowing the repetition of one small cave)
* Day 15, part 2 is slow (find quickest way through a maze)

### 2023

* Day 12, part 2
* Day 14, part 2
* Day 16, speed up part 1
* Day 16, speed up a little part 2
* Day 17, solve
* Day 20, solve
* Day 21, part 2
* Day 22, speed up falling bricks
* Day 23, part 2
* Day 24, fix part 2 example?
* Day 25, use Lean

### 2024

* Day 6, part 2 is slow (moving guard in a maze, finding locations of obstacles to create loops, almost 10 minutes)
* Day 7, part 2 is slow (filling in binary operations, trying to achieve a fixed total -- approx 1m30)
* Day 9, part 2 is slow (defragmenting a file-system, takes approximately 1 minute)
* Day 12, part 1 and 2 are slow (connected components, perimeters and corners, approx 1m each answer)
* Day 15, part 2 is slow (moving boxes around, approximately 3 minutes to get each answer)
* Day 16, part 1 and 2 are slow (Reindeer maze, 20/25 seconds to get each answer)
* Day 17, part 2 the test does not work (state machine that should reproduce itself -- possible bug,
  as it does not appear to work on a different input either)
* Day 18, part 2 is a little slow (historians and corrupted bytes -- hex-like maze, approximately 30s,
  possible bug, since it does not appear to work with a different input)
* Day 19, part 2 is slow (cheating programs through a maze -- Manhattan distance,
  approximately 1m -- try to implement by keeping track of the fact that shorter cheats are reused
  multiple times)
* Day 21, part 2 is slow (robots controlling robots, 25 times -- approximately 34s, solution from
  AoC forum)
* Day 22, part 2 is slow (minimizing price windows to obtain bananas -- bitwise operations,
  approximately 3m -- try to streamline the generation of the bits for speed up?)
* Day 23, part 2 takes approximately 11s, however, the test is quicker, but does not work!
* Day 24, part 2 is not automated: there is code to help find the transpositions, but not in a systematic way.
