#  [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

A list of `forward`, `up` and `down`, each followed by a number.

####  Test

<pre>
forward 5

forward 2
</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

Each one of `forward`, `up` and `down` represents a movement of a vector with two integer coordinates.
The puzzle consists of finding where you end up, if you start at `(0, 0)`.

#### Part 2

Now, each one of `forward`, `up` and `down` represents a movement of a vector with *three* integer coordinates.
The puzzle again consists of finding where you end up, if you start at `(0, 0, 0)`.

### Description

#### Part 1

We should determine the heights of the locations of the
</pre>low points":
these are the points on the elevation grid that have height less than or equal to all of their neighbours *and* actually strictly smaller than some neighbour.
The sum of the risk levels of these low points answers part 1.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we determine the product of the sizes of the three larges basins.
Each basin is obtained from a low point by growing in a connected manner until the boundary consists only of vertices of height 9 (that are not part of the basin) and external walls of the grid.

HC -> B
HN -> C
NN -> C
BH -> H
NC -> B
NB -> B
BN -> B
BB -> N

</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

The input consists of a starting polymer and the insertion rules for the polymer.
The puzzle consists in iteratively applying the insertion rules and reporting a statistic of the final distribution of elements.

#### Part 2

Same as part 2, except performing a larger number of iterations.
I initially coded part 1 following the most direct implementation of what was asked.
However, the current implementation is the more efficient one that I used in order to get the result for part 2.
The main observation is that the interleaved insertion hides the possibility of counting *multiplicities*.
Separating out the string in all of its pairs of adjacent elements makes counting with multiplicities possible and extends the reach of the algorithm.

#### Part 1

Find the smallest total sum of a path that starts from the top left corner and exists at the bottom right corner.

#### Part 2

Same as part 2, except that the grid is now 5 times larger in each direction.

My main realization for this puzzle was that finding the minimum weighted distances to *all* the points of the grid was more effective that just figuring out the value for one path.
Also, finding the minimum sum, but not also a minimizing path at the same time helped!
