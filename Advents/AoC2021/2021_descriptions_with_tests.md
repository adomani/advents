#  [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

A list of `forward`, `up` and `down`, each followed by a number.

####  Test

<pre>
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

Each one of `forward`, `up` and `down` represents a movement of a vector with two integer coordinates.
The puzzle consists of finding where you end up, if you start at `(0, 0)`.

#### Part 2

Now, each one of `forward`, `up` and `down` represents a movement of a vector with *three* integer coordinates.
The puzzle again consists of finding where you end up, if you start at `(0, 0, 0)`.

#### Part 2

For part 2, we apply the same procedure, but to the bingo card that wins last.

#  [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)

The inputs are lists of pairs of integer positions in the plane, representing the endpoints of line segments

####  Test

<pre>
0,9 -> 5,9
8,0 -> 0,8
9,4 -> 3,4
2,2 -> 2,1
7,0 -> 7,4
6,4 -> 2,0
0,9 -> 2,9
3,4 -> 1,4
0,0 -> 8,8
5,5 -> 8,2
</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

Considering only the line segments that are parallel to a coordinate axis, compute how many overlaps there are between the line segments, discounting multiplicities.

#### Part 2

For part 2, the question is the same, except that we include all line segments, not just the ones that are parallel to the coordinate axes.
There is the extra implicit assumption that all line segments are either parallel to the coordinate axes or form a 45‚Å∞ degree angle with the axes.

#  [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9)

The input is the elevation grid of the lava caves.

9856789892
8767896789
9899965678
</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

We should determine the heights of the locations of the
</pre>low points":
these are the points on the elevation grid that have height less than or equal to all of their neighbours *and* actually strictly smaller than some neighbour.
The sum of the risk levels of these low points answers part 1.

#### Part 2

For the second part, we determine the product of the sizes of the three larges basins.
Each basin is obtained from a low point by growing in a connected manner until the boundary consists only of vertices of height 9 (that are not part of the basin) and external walls of the grid.

Once that is done, the dots align to produce the code word below, that is the answer to the puzzle.

Inserting elements to form long polymers.

####  Test

CB -> H
NH -> C
HB -> C
HC -> B
HN -> C
NN -> C
BH -> H
NC -> B
NB -> B
BN -> B
BB -> N
BC -> B
CC -> N
CN -> C
</pre>

### Description

#### Part 1

The input consists of a starting polymer and the insertion rules for the polymer.
The puzzle consists in iteratively applying the insertion rules and reporting a statistic of the final distribution of elements.

#### Part 2

Same as part 2, except performing a larger number of iterations.
I initially coded part 1 following the most direct implementation of what was asked.
However, the current implementation is the more efficient one that I used in order to get the result for part 2.
The main observation is that the interleaved insertion hides the possibility of counting *multiplicities*.
Separating out the string in all of its pairs of adjacent elements makes counting with multiplicities possible and extends the reach of the algorithm.

### Description

#### Part 1

The input consists of $100 	imes 100$ grid of digits.
Find the smallest total sum of a path that starts from the top left corner and exists at the bottom right corner.

#### Part 2

Same as part 2, except that the grid is now 5 times larger in each direction.

My main realization for this puzzle was that finding the minimum weighted distances to *all* the points of the grid was more effective that just figuring out the value for one path.
Also, finding the minimum sum, but not also a minimizing path at the same time helped!
