The exploration state of the tails.
* `grid` is the `HashMap` deduced from the input, with a height for each map location.
* `paths` is the current `HashSet` of paths.

A path is an array of positions:
* for part 1, it is simply the start and end;
* for part 2, it is the full array of visited locations.

Reads the input `i` and creates the initial `TrailState`, loading the map and placing

Updates a `TrailState`, by expanding each path with one extra step aiming for height `i + 1`.
If the `all?` flag is `true`, then we record the full path;
if the `all?` flag is `false`, then we record just the beginning and the lastest location.
