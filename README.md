#  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

My current solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/).

So far, this repository contains only the 2023 edition.

Obviously, if you go to the files with code, there will be spoilers!

The files directly linked from this page should contain virtually no spoilers,
except possibly a [description](descriptions.md) of the questions,
that involves some parsing of the given text.
