#  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

My current solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/): they are all in [Advents](https://github.com/adomani/advents/tree/master/Advents).

So far, this repository contains only (partial) solutions to the
[2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021),
[2021](https://adventofcode.com/2023),
[2023](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and
[2024](https://adventofcode.com/2025) editions.

Obviously, if you go to the files with code, there will be spoilers!

The files directly linked from this page should contain virtually no spoilers,
except possibly a description of
* the [2021](https://github.com/adomani/advents/tree/master/Advents/AoC2021/2021_descriptions.md) questions,
* the [2023](https://github.com/adomani/advents/tree/master/Advents/AoC2023/2023_descriptions.md) questions,
* the [2024](https://github.com/adomani/advents/tree/master/Advents/AoC2024/2024_descriptions.md) questions,
* the [2025](https://github.com/adomani/advents/tree/master/Advents/AoC2025/2025_descriptions.md) questions,

that involves some parsing of the given text.

As soon as you navigate to a page that is not linked from here, you will likely find spoilers and complete solutions!
